Sticky Notes application with Django

I have been working on a Sticky Notes application with Django, by following the below instructions.

1. Use the design techniques and principles learnt in the bootcamp
to design a sticky notes application. Must also submit the following:
    ○ Use case diagram
    ○ Sequence diagram
    ○ Class diagram
2. Create a new Django project called sticky_notes to serve as the backbone
for the task manager application.
3. Install the app in settings.py. Configure the Django project settings to
include the newly created app.
4. Design and define the model for the sticky notes application, including
fields for the title and content of each note.
5. Implement and run database migrations to ensure that the model is
reflected in the database.
6. Develop views that handle the CRUD functionality for the sticky notes
application, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete notes.
7. Build forms that facilitate the input and editing of sticky notes content.
8. Set up URL patterns to map the different views of the sticky notes
application. Include these URLs in the main urls.py. Ensure that the URLs of
the sticky notes app are appropriately included in the main urls.py file.
9. Create a base HTML template that can be extended by other templates in
the application.
10. Design HTML templates for displaying sticky notes content, integrating
them with the views.
11. Style the sticky notes application by adding CSS to enhance the visual
appeal. It is OK to use Bootstrap to speed up the CSS development.
12. Configure the Django project to collect static files, including CSS, into a
designated directory.
13. Extend the application by implementing functionality to create posts for
the bulletin board app.
14. Rerun migrations to ensure that any changes are reflected in the database,
and start the development server to test the application.
15. Design and implement tests to ensure they cover the use cases of the sticky
notes application.
16. Run the tests you've created to validate the correctness of the
implementation.
17. Ensure that you also manually test the application to ensure that there are
no obvious bugs.
